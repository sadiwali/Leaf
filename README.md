Leaf is a simple plugin that enables L-systems inside Grasshopper. In addition to the basic L-System grammars, this plugin also supports stochastic grammars, and context-sensitive grammars.

Symbols can be substituted with imported geometry via the Leaf Geometry component, and the Leaf Turtle component.
